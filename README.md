**Why this design?**

As I got my Audi A6 with keyless go, I usually tend to loosen my keys inside the car. Also, there have been some annoying processes like using a card to enter the parking lot area. Since I had to deal with a used car being equipped with a ash tray, I decided to go and talk to a couple of car owners in a german forum (motor-talk, thanks to those guys for the input) and we made a study of what is needed to be done. I then came along with this particular design.
